## 🌍 Project Overview
ExoVision is an AI-powered system that automates the detection of exoplanets from NASA’s Kepler mission data.  
It combines an **XGBoost model** for tabular feature classification and a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for light curve analysis, dramatically accelerating the discovery of exoplanets.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
- **XGBoost** analyzes Kepler tabular features like orbital period, transit depth, and equilibrium temperature.  
- **CNN** learns directly from raw stellar flux time series data.  
- The Flask backend provides REST endpoints for predictions and performance metrics.  
- The React-based frontend allows users to upload data and visualize classifications instantly.
